# ER_DCA Protein Structure Prediction with DCA-Expectation Reflection
=======================

This repository is supplementarty to the publication (PUBLICATION LINK). In the different jupyter notebooks you can run the different steps of our method including:
* Data acuisition and preprocessing 
* Parallel computation of Direct Information
* Method result plotting
* Comparison with other popular methods

Feel free to contact <evancresswell@gmail.com> or <vipulp@niddk.nih.gov > regarding questions on implementation and execution of repo

#### Package Requirements
- Anaconda/Miniconda - to run the proper enviornment for code. If using another python package manager see the following files for enviornment requirements 
    - Expectation Reflection Environment: DCA_ER_requirments.txt
    - PYDCA Enviornment: PDYCA_requirements.txt

# Anaconda Environment Setup
[Back to Top](#Table-of-Contents)
	- Assumes you have Anaconda or Miniconda: https://www.anaconda.com/
	- If not using Anaconda or Miniconda see the following files for the DCA_ER and PYDCA requiremetns
		- DCA_ER_requirments.txt
    		- Enviornment: PDYCA_requirements.txt
* We want to create two environments for our implementation of Expectaion Reflection (DCA_ER env) and for the PYDCA implementation of the Mean Field and Pseudoliklihood models (PYDCA env)
* To create these envirnoments in conda simply execute the following commands
```console
foo@bar:~$ conda create --name DCA_ER --file DCA_ER_requirements.txt 
foo@bar:~$ conda create --name PYDCA --file PDYCA_requirements.txt
```
See Anaconda documentation for more on environment maintenence and implementation: https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html

# PDB to MSA Mapping
[Back to Top](#Table-of-Contents)

* Given a PDB structure file we use ProDy to search all available Pfam alignments for the best matching Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA)
* We outline this process with a jupyter notebook using PDB ID 1ZDR as an example


### Example in PDB2MSA.ipynb jupyter notebook

# Expectiation Reflection
[Back to Top](#Table-of-Contents)
	- Assumes you have the following files in **/path/to/er_covid19/** 
		- subject genome file: **wuhan_ref.fasta** 
		- aligned genome file: **covid_genome_full_aligned.fasta** (created in [Full Genome Alignment][#Full-Genome-Alignment])
		- directory for output: **/path/to/er_covid19/cov_fasta_files/**

- once you have an aligned file you can get DI using ER using run_covGENOME_ER.py
- file generates .pickle files with DI
- the different clade and full sequence run are already defined in run_cov_GENOME_ER file.
	- for all clades see **submit_DI_clade_swarm.script**:
```console
foo@bar:~$ ./submit_DI_clade_swarm.script
```
	- for full genome see **run_covGENOME_ER.py**
		- hardcoded existing full aligned file
```console
foo@bar:~$  singularity exec -B /path/to/er_covid19/biowulf/,/path/to/er_covid19/covid_proteins /path/to/er_covid19/LADER.simg python run_covGENOME_ER.py 
```


# Other Methods

## Scripts and Drivers
* incidence_plotting.py - file for plotting incidence by **region** and **clade**
* gen_incidence_data.py - driver for generating paper incidence data 
* make_codon_swarm.py - script to create swarm (cluster) file to map sequences to to resulting amino acids using **codon_mapping.py**
* make_pair_aa_swarm.py - script to create swarm (cluster) file to map network interactions (from ER simulation) to resulting amino acids using **codon_mapping.py**
* codon_mapping.py - file which maps a given sequence/region of nucleotides to the resulting amino acid
* print_pair_counts.py - driver for creating lists of amino acid pair counts from ER-inferred position pairs (detailed description in file)
* covid_aa_bp_variance.py - a file which computes statistics of amino acid and basepair expression from given genome positions
* plot_covid_genome_CT.py - file for plotting co-evolving postions of genome by **region** and **clade**
* expectation_reflection.py - file to run inference of network interactions using Expectation Reflection

## Results
[Back to Top](#Table-of-Contents)
All the data generated by the above scripts are in the Results/ directory and are organized as follows.
## Result Data:
- **.pickle** files containing DI of full genome and clades both processed and unprocessed
- **.npy** files containing amino acid and basepair data for infered genome positions
- **.txt** files containing all DI pairs from clade and full genome simulations (for inspection without python run)
